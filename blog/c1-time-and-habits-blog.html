        Time Management: Not my strong suit. 
        I am one of those perpetually late people who's friends make up meeting times of half an hour earlier just so I will be there on time. 
        For some reason I seem to think it takes 5 minutes to get anywhere in Auckland and 15 minutes to do ANY activity... Grocery shopping, lunch, watching a movie???  
        So of course I approached this part of the Sprint with slight apprehension.

        But I'm definitely keen to improve in this area, so I am addopting the Pomodoro technique, which with my current short concentration span seems to suit me quite well. 
        Also, reviewing each task prior to starting and timeboxing how long I think it should take (in pomodoros). 
        I've started meditating. Again. This is something I've attempted on and off several times in the past and never mnaged to make it stick. 
        Back to the headspace app though and already managed 8 minutes today. Lol.

        The concept on 'starting small' I found to be really interesting. I'd like to experiement with the Fogg technique to improve my punctuality.
        Watch this space.
