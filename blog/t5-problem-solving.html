            <em>Getting blocked on a simple problem</em>
          </p>
          <p> 
            I have had a few moments since starting this course where I have become stuck on 
            some code which isn't working before realising the solution was as simple as a missed 
            curly bracket, or absent semi-colon. To get to these solutions was a matter of going 
            through my code section by section to figure out where the error lay - and then feeling 
            a bit stupid when you realise how simple the solution is! It definitely pays to re-read 
            any code you've just written in order to identify these sorts of issues early on.

            <em>Solving a problem in an elegent way</em>
          </p>
          <p>
            Not entirely sure what 'elegant' way means but I managed to get my minesweeper game working for a while, 
            after using a variety of different methods, including googling, looking at other people's 
            solutions, speaking to coaches, more googling, trying different things, and some more googling. 
            The minesweeper sprint has definitely been my hardest challenge so far, and has really pushed 
            my problem solving skills to the limit! Some good advice I was given was try to not let it 
            stress you out, take lots of breaks and don't be afaid to ask for help. In saying that, as of 
            right now my minesweeper game isn't working again, and I'm really stuck as to why not!

            <em>Reflecting on problem solving methods</em>
          </p>
          <p>
           <ul>
             <li>Pseudocode - I have not used this problem solving method at all but am keen to try.</li>
             <li>Trying something - This is something I do a lot! Add code, test, change code, test, delete code, try new code, test...</li>
             <li>Rubber ducky method - I like this concept and it is something I'd like to use however when I went to try it I couldn't even explain what my own code was doing so it fell a bit flat!</li>
             <li>Reading error messages - Error messages are useful for mainly syntax issues, missing commas or colons or curly brackets.</li>
             <li>Console.logging - Have not done this as yet.</li>
             <li>Googling - Google is my second home :)</li>
             <li>Asking your peers - This is something I need to improve on!</li>
             <li>Asking coaches - I have utilised the EDA coaches on a few occasions for both technical help and general motivation.</li>
             <li>Improving your process with reflection - Sometimes just taking  break from staring at the screen (and hitting your head on the keyboard) then sitting outside or somewhere else to mull on your problem can be really beneficial and allow you to view the issue in a new light. I do this often.</li>
           </ul>
