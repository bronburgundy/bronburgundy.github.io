            <em>Process over Product</em>
          </p>
          <p> 
            The 'process over product concept' was something I really struggled with for this 
            sprint essentially because it meant finishing my site when I wasn't 100% happy with it.
            The inner perfectionish in me revolted against this pretty hard, and I ended up going 
            over my allocated time. This is something I really need to work on, as it is not always 
            possible to launch a project with it being 100% perfect.

            <em>Inital ideas on Meditation</em>
          </p>
          <p>
            Before reading chapter 2 of 'Search Inside Yourself' I had some knowledge of meditation, 
            having been using the Headspace App off and on for a few years. However, I've never managed 
            to make a lasting regular practice of it, and I'm hoping the meditation work I'm doing on 
            this course will help me achieve that.

            <em>Meditation Learnings</em>
          </p>
          <p>
            Chapter 2 of 'Search Inside Yourself' talks more about the practise of mindful meditation, 
            and the theory behind it. There are several key points in this chapter that I found really 
            interesting, the first being that meditation is like exercise for the brain, and can be 
            practised and improved on over time, just like physical exercise. I also loved the concept 
            of 'intention creating' - that if you create the same intention over and over, it essentially 
            becomes a reality for you.

            <em>Meditation Techniques</em>
          </p>
          <p>
            I am still using the Headspace App for my meditation practice as I find it a good way to 
            guide my practise, but I also like the technique they discuss in this chapter on how to deal 
            with distractions:
          </p>  
          <ol>
            <li>Acknowledge.</li>
            <li>Experience without judging or reacting.</li>
            <li>If you need to react, continue maintaining mindfulness while doing so, using intention, 
              movement, and sensation.</li>
            <li>Let it go.</li>  
          <ol>
