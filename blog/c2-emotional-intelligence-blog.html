            <em>'Search Inside Yourself' Learnings</em>
          </p>
          <p> 
            In Chapter 1 of 'Search Inside Yourself' the author give us a summary of what 
            Emotional Intelligence is and how important it is in all facets of our lives, 
            both personal and professional. This is information I sort of already knew, but 
            it's really interesting to see it backed up by actual science and research, 
            especially in regards to our overrall happiness in life.  
            <br>
            <br>
            I find the whole topic of mindfulness, meditation, yoga and being 'zen' really 
            interesting as I think it could make such a profound difference in so many 
            people's lives if it was something that was brought to the forefront of society - ie. 
            taught in schools and kindergartens and practised in workplaces. It could potentially 
            lead to less crime, less violence, less wars, and more compassion and understanding 
            for our fellow man.

            <em>Two Minutes of Mindfulness</em>
          </p>
          <p>
            I use the app Headspace to help me do 2 minutes of mindful meditatation. 
            Although it sounds so easy in theory, in practise I find it really difficult 
            to try and focus on one thing for 2 minutes. But I also know if I stuck at it, 
            it would get easier and easier. Throughout this course I am attempting to 
            meditate for a few minutes every day.
