            <em>Relationship between mindfulness and self-awareness</em>
          </p>
          <p> 
            Mindfulness and self-awareness are very closely related, in some ways they can almost be 
            considered almost the same thing - Mindfulness has elements of self-awareness in it, and 
            vice versa. I would say that mindfulness is a more broad term however, and explains a state 
            of mind, whereas self-awareness is more of a momentary thing.
          </p>

            <em>Self-awareness practices</em>
          </p>
          <p>
            I tried the body scan method of self-awareness. I did it sitting upright in a chair as 
            I knew if tried it lying down I would definitely fall asleep! I have practised similar 
            exercises to this in yoga classes, and am always surprised by how much tension I am holding
            in my body - especially my shoulders, back and legs. I find this also when I get a massage - 
            only when lying down still on the table do I realise how tense I am holding myself, and it
            takes a while for me to get my body to fully relax. I am keen to try this practise at night
            after getting into bed in the hopes it helps me to sleep!

            <em>"My emotions are not me"</em>
          </p>
          <p>
            This section resonated really strongly with me, as I have definitely been a slave to my 
            emotions in the past. Learning how to watch my emotions come and go without taking them 
            on board as 'part of me' is something I would really like to improve on - I think it 
            would lead to a calmer, more focussed mind, less likely to get bogged down with emotional
            responses.
